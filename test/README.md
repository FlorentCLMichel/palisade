File Listing
------------

* test
- [build_all_backends.sh](test/build_all_backends.sh) builds the library for all valid math backends. Each backend is placed in its own bin directory, bin/backend-N, where N is the backend number. Does a clean build of all backends, unless a backend number is passed on the command line; in that case, only that backend is built, WITHOUT a clean
- [test_all_backends.sh](test/test_all_backends.sh) runs "make testall" on each of the backends built by build_all_backends, unless a backend number is passed on the command line; in that case, only that backend is tested

- [build_cov_test_backends.sh](test/build_cov_test_backends.sh) builds the library for all valid math backends with coverage testing available. Each backend is placed in its own bin directory, bin/backend-N-cov, where N is the backend number. Does a clean build of all backends, unless a backend number is passed on the command line; in that case, only that backend is built, WITHOUT a clean
- [test_cov_backends.sh](test/test_cov_backends.sh) runs coverage test on each of the backends built by build_cov_test_backend, unless a backend number is passed on the command line; in that case, only that backend is tested

- [benchmark_all_backends.sh](test/benchmark_all_backends.sh) runs benchmarks against the backends built by build_all_backends.sh

- [valgrind_all_backends.sh](test/valgrind_all_backends.sh) runs valgrind on the unit tests for the backends built by build_all_backends, unless a backend number is passed on the command line; in that case, only that backend is tested

* test/include:
- [gtest](test/include/gtest) contains all
