# This script is meant to uninstall PALISADE installed on a Linux, Mac, or MinGW distribution.
# 
# NOTE - the bash expansion is a little convoluted, here's a better explanation for those interested
# 
# > _inc=$(cat install_manifest.txt|grep "/include/palisade" | head -n 1)
# 
# Results in something like `/usr/local/include/palisade/core/config_core.h` but the file maybe different over time
# What this does is finds all the lines containing "/include/palisade" and then selects only the first result
# 
# > ${_inc%palisade*}palisade
# 
# Results in /usr/local/include/palisade
# This will trim everything, including "palisade" for the string, thus "palisade" must be concatenated back onto the 
# remainder.
